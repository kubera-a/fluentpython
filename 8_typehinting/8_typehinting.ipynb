    "Since Duck and Clown here both support the `quack` method, they are considered the same type. Duck typing is only enforced at runtime and results in more flexibility, but usually at the cost of more errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia: In computer programming, duck typing is an application of the duck test—\"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck\"—to determine whether an object can be used for a particular purpose. With nominative typing, an object is of a given type if it is declared as such (or if a type's association with the object is inferred through mechanisms such as object inheritance). With duck typing, an object is of a given type if it has all methods and properties required by that type."
